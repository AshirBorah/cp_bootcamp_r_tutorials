# R Bootcamp for Biologists/Clinicians

This work was started as part of the Cancer Program Bootcamp at the Broad by Ashir Borah and James McFarland from the Cancer Data Science team at Dependency Map. It draws inspiration from several other popular courses like HBC Intro to R [course](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R/schedules/1.5-day.html), Sam Meier's 2018 R lectures and Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

To get started, please [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) into your computer and install R(version > 4.0), RStudio and run the install script `install.R` by opening it in RStudio and executing the file.

[Lesson 0](https://ashir.shinyapps.io/lesson_0_pres/) will help you with the installation of R, RStudio and the packages.
