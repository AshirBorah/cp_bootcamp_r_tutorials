## Why learn to code as a cancer researcher?

- **Reproducible** data analysis: 
 
  - Document and share exactly how you analyzed your data
  
  - Do more with your analysis, more efficiently:

  - More control and flexibility

  - Use community-created analysis tools

  - Leverage cancer data resources (often large datasets)

  - Create awesome visualizations

## Imagined learning curve

## Course goals

- Get everyone past 'valley of despair' in R learning curve

- Convince you that R is an accessible and useful tool for you in your research

- Prepare you to tackle BootCamp projects next week 

- Get you excited to keep developing these coding skills!


## Why R specifically 

<center>
<img src="images/why_R.png" width="30%">
</center>


**Upsides**

- Free

- LOTS of bioinformatics/stats tools available

**Downsides?**

- It's a hodge-podge

- Not the best for engineering software

# R Basics

## Key Tools

<center>
<img src="images/Rtools_car.png" width="60%">
</center>

- **R Markdown/Notebooks**

  - Sort of like a lab notebook for analysis

  - Easily share results and methods in different formats

  - Encourages good code and analysis practices


## The R console

Where the action happens!

- Provide inputs to R
  
- See outputs of commands you give it (each on separate line)


## Create project directory

- Organize your work as 'Projects' in Rstudio

- Each project has a separate folder, with data, code, results.

- Create a 'Project' in Rstudio
  
## R as calculator

List of key math operations

- `*`: multiplication
- `/`: division
- `+`: addition
- `-`: subtraction
- `^`: 'raise to the power'

## Logical operations

- `==` Check equals
- `!=` Check not equals
- `>` Greater than, `<` less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to, etc.

```{r r_logicals}
2^2 == 3
```


## Objects in R

- **Variables**: 

  - Store information/data (the "nouns")
  - Come in a number of flavors 

- **Functions**:

  - Set of instructions to perform some task (the "verbs")
  - We'll come back to these in a bit

## Creating variables

- You can create new variables with `<-`

```{r var_create}
x <- 3 * 4
x
```

-   All object-creation statements have the form 
      
      -   `object_name <- value`

      -   You can use `=`, but `<-` makes for better R code


```{r obj_create}
color1 = 'red'
color2 <- 'red'
color1 == color2
```





## Variable types in R  {.small-bullets}

-   **Numbers**

```{r}
x <- 1
x <- 1.592E-39
```

-   **Strings (text)**

```{r}
x <- 'abc'
x <- "abc"
```

-   **Logical (true/false)**

```{r}
x <- TRUE
x <- FALSE
```

-   **Factors (categorical variables)**
  
    - e.g. ('bad', 'OK', 'good', 'great')
    
    - We will mostly try to avoid these, but be aware of them.


## Variable naming 

-   Variable names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, '`_`', and '`.`'. 

Not allowed: `4th`, `my var`, `weird?`, etc. etc.

-   Object naming is **important** for writing good, readable, code

-   Make variable names descriptive

`avgClicks`

-   Make function names verbs

`calculate_avg_clicks`


NOT: `var1` or `a`

## Use comments!

- Code readability is huge so others can understand what you've done

  - Including future you!

- In RMarkdown docs, write descriptive text before each code chunk

- Also good to add comments to key lines of code within chunks


## R environment

- See info on current variables

- Clearing variables

- View data tables, etc.


# Data Structures

## Commonly used R data structures

- Vectors

- Lists

- Matrix

- Dataframes


## Vectors {.smaller-bullets}

- Ordered collection of values. Like a sequence of 'buckets'

- Can hold numeric data

<center>
<img src="images/vector2.png" width="40%">
</center>

- Or text (strings)

<center>
<img src="images/vector1.png" width="40%">
</center>

- Or boolean data (TRUE/FALSE)

<center>
<img src="images/vector5-logical.png" width="40%">
</center>

- **All data in a vector has to be the same type!**


## Making vectors

-   Use 'combine' function `c()`

```{r c_function}
num_vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)

log_vec <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, F)

str_vec <- c('this', 'is', 'a', 'vector', 'of', 'strings')

print(num_vec)
```

-   Shorthand to create a sequence of integers

```{r range}
1:4
```



## Missing values

- Quick notes on missing values in R (will be important)

- `NA` ('not available') is a special value for missing data that can be included in any type of vector

```{r NA_intro}
c(1, 2, NA)
c('a', 'b', NA)
```


## Adding more data on to vectors {.smaller}

`c()` can also be used to add new elements to a vector

```{r c_function_cont, exercise = TRUE}
string_vec <- c("TP53", "PLEC", "DSPP", "PIK3CA")
string_vec2 <- c(string_vec, "BRAF")
string_vec2
```


Combining two vectors

```{r combine_vec_function}
string_vec <- c("TP53", "PLEC", "DSPP", "PIK3CA")
string_vec2 <- c("BRAF", "EGFR", "DUSP4")
c(string_vec, string_vec2)
```



## Lists 

Lists are basically like relaxed vectors, where elements don't have to be the same type

```{r list_intro}
z <- list('a', 1, TRUE)
z
```

---

You can combine lists with the `c()` function as with vectors

```{r}
z <- list('a', 1, TRUE)
c(z, 'c')
```



## Matrix

- Like vectors, but arranged in 2d with rows and columns

<center>
<img src="images/matrix.png" width="40%">
</center>

- Example: gene expression values across genes and samples 


## Dataframe

- Most common way of interacting with data

- Each column is a vector, and they can hold different kinds of data

- Like an Excel table. 

<center>
<img src="images/dataframe.png" width="40%">
</center>



## Key concepts recap

- Use RMarkdown documents like an experiment notebook

- Create variables with `<-`, naming them is important

- Variables can be numbers, text (strings) or TRUE/FALSE (boolean)

- Data organized as vectors, lists, matrices, and dataframes

- Create/add to vectors (or lists) with `c()`

- Make lists with `list()`
