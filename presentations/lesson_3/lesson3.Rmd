- Working with matrices

- Working with dataframes (the old fashioned way)


# R and Rstudio 

<center>
<img src="images/Rtools_car.png" width="60%">
</center>

<!-- - **R Markdown/Notebooks** -->

<!--   - Sort of like a lab notebook for analysis -->

<!--   - Easily share results and methods in different formats -->

<!--   - Encourages good code and analysis practices -->


## Different ways to work with R

- Enter commands directly into the console 

- Write 'scripts': set of R code to execute as a unit  (.R files)

- Write 'packages': sets of functions that others can use

- **Write analysis 'notebooks'** (R markdown: .Rmd files)

  - Easily share results and methods in different formats

  - Encourages good code and analysis practices



## Rstudio: Live demo

<!-- Also set up project folder live demo -->

- Different components of Rstudio interface

- Running code lines

- Running code chunks

- Creating new chunks

- Creating, inspecting and clearing variables

- There are many good Rstudio video tutorials, e.g.: (https://youtu.be/kfcX5DEMAp4)


<!-- ## R environment -->

<!-- <!-- This can be incorporated in the live demo --> -->

<!-- - See info on current variables -->

<!-- - Clearing variables -->

<!-- - View data tables, etc. -->


## Make your code readable!

<!-- UPDATE -->

- **Why?**

  - Others can understand what you've done (including future you)
  
  - Reproducibility and open science
  
  - Clarify your logical thought process while writing code

- **How?**

  - Write descriptive text before each code chunk in R notebooks:
  
    - Describe data used, analysis approach
    
    - What are you trying to test/show with a given analysis?

## Comments

Also good to include comments in your code for specifics/lightweight explanation

- R ignores stuff after `#`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#add a fixed offset to avoid negative values
new_data <- old_data + offset 

#now normalize so max value is 1
new_data <- new_data/max(new_data)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
new_data <- my_pipeline_function(new_data, outliers = 'ignore') #drop 6-sigma outliers
```



## Create project directory

- Organize your work as 'Projects' in Rstudio

- Each project has a separate folder, with data, code, results.

- You will practice setting up a new project for today's assignment. 


# Loading data

## Basics of data formats 

- Small-scale data are typically stored as text files

- Different 'rows' of data appear on different lines

- Values for a given 'row' are typically separated by either a comma, or a tab


## Comma-separated values (.csv) {.code-big}
 
```
name,age,member_since
bob,20,2015
frank,40,2015
tammy,15,2016
```

## Tab-separated values (.tsv or .txt) {.code-big}

```{}
name  age  member_since
bob  20  2015
frank  40  2015
tammy  15  2016
```


## A zoo of data loading functions

| Data type               | Extension | Function          | Package            |
|:------------------------|:----------|:------------------|:-------------------|
| Comma separated values  | csv       | `read.csv()`      | utils (default)    |
|                         |           | `read_csv()`      | readr (tidyverse)  |
| Tab separated values    | tsv       | `read_tsv()`      | readr              |
| Other delimited formats | txt       | `read.table()`    | utils              |
|                         |           | `read_table()`    | readr              |
|                         |           | `read_delim()`    | readr              |
| Excel                   | xlsx, xls | `read_excel()`    | readxl (tidyverse) |


## Practical advice on data loading

- For loading data tables, we suggest:

  - Use `read_delim` (part of the `tidyverse` megapackage) for text files (.csv, .tsv, .txt)
  
  - Use `read_excel` for loading .xls, .xlsx files

- We'll discuss more about loading data matrices later.

- For example: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_table <- read_delim('my_data_file.csv')
```



## Specifying where a file 'is'

File locations ('paths') can be specified in absolute or relative terms

- An 'absolute' path specifies where exactly in your computer's 'directory structure' a given file lives

- For example: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
imported_data <- read_csv("/Users/jmmcfarl/BootCamp/cp_r_bootcamp/
                          data/data_file.csv")
```

- `data_file.csv` lives inside `data` folder, inside `cp_r_boocamp`, etc.

- But these will vary from computer to computer, so makes code sharing harder..


## Relative paths

This will look for the file inside your 'working directory'

```{r, eval = FALSE}
imported_data <- read_csv('data_file.csv')
```

What's the working directory and how does it get set?


## To avoid having to worry about this 

  - Organize project-specific data in a 'data' subfolder and use Rstudio projects
  
  - Use the `here` function from the `here` package to find the right relative path within the project.
  
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(here)
here('data', 'my_data_file.csv')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
here('data', 'my_data_file.csv')
```

  
You can use it like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
imported_csv <- read_delim(here('data', 'data_file.csv'))
imported_tsv <- read_delim(here('data', 'tab_separated_table.tsv'))
```


## Loading from Excel sheets

Load the second sheet from an xlsx file

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_table <- read_excel(here('data', 'my_metadata_file.xlsx'), sheet = 2)
```

Uses the `readxl` package part of `tidyverse`


## Loading matrices

<center>
<img src="images/matrix_named.png" width="50%">
<!-- <img src="images/matrix.png" width="30%"> -->
<!-- <img src="images/dataframe.png" width="30%"> -->
</center>
 
  - The size of matrices is often too large for `read_delim` to work well.
  
  - The first column is special: 'row names'


## Loading matrices

- Let's use `fread` from the `data.table` package

- `fread` creates a slightly different type of table than we want. `as_tibble` converts to the right kind.
  
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(data.table)
counts_matrix <-  fread(here('data', 'counts_rpkm.csv'))
counts_matrix <- as_tibble(counts_matrix) #convert to a 'tibble'
corner(counts_matrix)
```

## Loading matrices

Then we want to make one of the column rownames and mint our new data matrix

```{r}
counts_matrix <- column_to_rownames(counts_matrix, var = 'Gene') #set Gene column to rownames
counts_matrix <- as.matrix(counts_matrix) #formally make it a matrix, not really necessary
corner(counts_matrix)
```


## Inspecting data {.smaller}

- Always start with some quick inspection of data after reading it into R

- Check for:

  - Column (always) and row (matrix only) names are correct

  - Make sure data types of columns are correct
  
- Useful inspection functions:

  - `View(df)`: Open spreadsheet viewer
  - `head(df)`: Show top K (10) rows
  - `glimpse(df)`: quick overview of a table
  - `useful::corner(mat)`: Show upper left corner of matrix
  - `dim(mat)`: Number of rows and columns
  - `rownames(mat)`/`colnames(mat)`: extract row/column names


## Backup plan

- If you're having trouble with the above data loading strategies

- Or you want to load a data file that's not part of your local project directory (and don't want to bother with file paths)

- You can import files using the RStudio `Import Dataset` tool (see [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/218611977-Importing-Data-with-the-RStudio-IDE) for more info).


# Working with data in R

## 3 ways to access data

- By position

- By logical conditions

- By name

## Selecting by position

```{r}
age <- c(15, 22, 45, 52, 73, 81)
```

<img src="images/vector-index.png">

```{r}
age[5]
```

```{r}
idx <- c(3,5,6) # create vector of the elements of interest
age[idx]
```



## Selecting elements with logical statements {.smaller}

| Operator | Description |
| :-----------:|:-------------|
| > | greater than |
| >= | greater than or equal to|
| < | less than |
| <= | less than or equal to |
| == | equal to |
| != | not equal to |
| & | and |
| \| |or |

---

<img src="images/vector-index.png">

```{r}
age > 50
```

```{r}
log_idx <- age > 50
age[log_idx]
#same as age[age > 50]
```

---

<img src="images/vector-index.png">

```{r}
age == 52
```

```{r}
age[age == 52]
```

```{r}
age[age != 52]
```


## Subsetting using names 

Can assign names to each element in a vector

```{r}
age <- c(Allice = 15, Bob = 22, Charlie = 45, Dan = 52)
age
```

```{r}
names(age)
```

Can also set names on a given vector
```{r, eval = FALSE}
age <- c(15, 22, 45, 52)
names(age) <- c('Allice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Dan')
```


## Subsetting using names 

```{r}
age
```

Selecting elements by name is generally unambiguous

```{r}
age[c('Bob', 'Charlie')]
```

- Vectors often are unnamed. 

- Most useful when working with lists (more to come)


## Brief asside on NULL

R has another special value `NULL` which represents 'the absence of a value'.

For example
```{r}
my_vec <- c(1,2,3)
names(my_vec)
```

Note: Subtly different from `NA`, but don't worry about that now.


## Reordering data

```{r}
x <- c(4, 2, 3, 5, 1)
sort(x)
```

- Or in decreasing order
```{r}
sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)
```


## Reordering using indexing

Indexing can also be used to reorder data

```{r}
teaching_team <- c("Mary", "Meeta", "Radhika")
```

```{r}
reorder_teach <- teaching_team[c(3, 1, 2)] # Saving the results to a variable
reorder_teach
```




## Subsetting matrices

- Same as subsetting vectors, but can be applied to both rows and columns!

- General formula:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
matrix[row_set, column_set]
```

- `row_set` and `column_set` can be individual elements or vectors

- Leave either blank if you want all rows/columns, e.g.:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
matrix[row_set, ] #keeps all columns

matrix[, column_set] #keeps all rows
```

## Matrix subsetting examples

```{r, echo = FALSE}
counts_mat <- fread(here('data', 'counts_rpkm.csv'))
counts_mat <- as_tibble(counts_mat)
counts_mat <- column_to_rownames(counts_mat, var = 'Gene')
counts_mat <- as.matrix(counts_mat)
```

```{r}
useful::corner(counts_mat)
```


- 'Slice' out the third row

```{r}
counts_mat[3, ]
```

## Matrix subsetting examples

- Or slice out the third column

```{r}
counts_mat[, 3]
```

## Matrix subsetting examples

- Slice a set of rows and set of columns

```{r}
counts_mat[1:4, 2:3]
```

## Using rownames and column names

- Use `colnames(mat)` and `rownames(mat)` to get/set the column and row names of a matrix.

- Data for a specified set of rows (genes)

```{r}
counts_mat[c('ENSMUSG00000000028', 'ENSMUSG00000000037'), ]
```



- Specifying columns and rows by name
```{r}
counts_mat['ENSMUSG00000000001', c('sample7', 'sample5')]
```



## The %in% operator

- Check whether each element of vector1 is contained in the set vector2

```{r}
A <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
B <- c(3, 4, 5, 6)

A %in% B
```


## Applications of %in% 

Useful for restricting to the intersection of elements in two lists

```{r}
A <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
B <- c(3, 4, 5, 6)

A[A %in% B]
```



Or checking whether any/all elements of A are contained in B

```{r}
any(A %in% B)
all(A %in% B)
```


## Other 'set' functions

- `intersect(A, B)`: return the elements in both `A` and `B`

- `setdiff(A, B)`: return the elements in `A` that are not in `B`

- `union(A, B)`: return the elements in either `A` or `B`




## Inspecting data visually


<!-- ```{r, include = FALSE} -->
<!-- counts_mat <- read_csv(here('data', 'counts_rpkm.csv')) -->
<!-- counts_mat <- column_to_rownames(counts_mat, var = 'Gene') -->
<!-- counts_mat <- as.matrix(counts_mat) -->
<!-- ``` -->


```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height = 4}
x <- counts_mat['ENSMUSG00000081010',]
hist(x)
```

## Inspecting data visually

```{r,  fig.width=5, fig.height = 4}
x <- counts_mat['ENSMUSG00000081010',]
y <- counts_mat['ENSMUSG00000000037',]
plot(x,y)
```




## Subsetting lists {.smaller}

A list of lists

```{r}
people <- list(
  Allice = list(age = 20, height = 50, school = 'MIT'),
  Bob = list(age = 10, height = 30, school = 'Harvard'),
  Charlie = list(age = 40, height = 60, school = 'BU'),
  Frank = c(age = 10, height = 2)
  )
```

- To select a specific element from the list use 'double brackets'

```{r}
people[[2]]
```



## Subsetting lists {.smaller}

With lists it's especially useful to access elements by name

```{r}
people[['Bob']]
```

Another (equivalent) way is to use the `$` symbol. This is nice because it works with 'tab-complete'

```{r, eval = FALSE}
people$Bob
```

## Nested indexing of lists

- You can use multiple indices to pull out specific elements nested within a list

```{r}
people[['Allice']][['school']]
```

- Using `$` makes it easier to read

```{r}
people$Allice$height
```



## Creating dataframes 

```{r}
species <- c("ecoli", "human", "corn")
glengths <- c(4.6, 3000, 50000)
```

- Create a tibble (dataframe, table) using `tibble()` function.

- Input as many columns as you want (must have same length)

```{r}
df <- tibble(species, glengths)
df
```

## Creating dataframes 

You can name the columns

```{r}
df <- tibble(animal_species = species, genome_lengths = glengths)
df
```


## Quick note on new/old ways

- `data.frame()` is the old way, gives a similar table

```{r}
df <- data.frame(species = species, glengths = glengths)
df
```

- But it makes strings into 'factors', and has some other subtle differences.

- Use `tibble()` to avoid some rare but confusing issues

- Sometimes we'll use the terms 'dataframe', 'tibble', and 'table' interchangeably though.


## Extracting a single column

```{r, include = FALSE}
df <- tibble(species, glengths)
```

You can access a column from a tibble as if it were a list of vectors (it is):

```{r}
df$species
df[['species']]
```

## Subsetting dataframes 

You can access rows and columns of dataframes like matrix indexing

```{r}
df[2,]
```

```{r}
df[2:3, 'glengths']
```


## Saving data to a file

- Just like the inverse of reading data

- `write_csv` to save tables

- `write.csv` to save matrices (keeps row names)

- Use `here` function to specify the path to save the file 

```{r, eval=F}
write_csv(df, here('results', 'my_dataframe.csv'))
```


# Key concepts recap

- Reading data in R is kinda of a mess, but stick with `read_delim` for tables, `read_excel` for Excel files, and `data.table::fread` for matrices

- You can extract data from a vector by numeric index, name, or using logical conditions

- Matrices and data frames are the same, you just specify which rows and columns

- Lists are a bit weird, but use `$` to pull out elements by name
